Espressivo (Alpha)
==========
Espressivo is an open-source music player which can be controlled by any device
with access to your home network and the ability to issue HTTP commands.

Espressivo users control the music being played by adding their choice of
songs to the stream: a continuously running playlist. The administrator 
is the only user with the ability to start and stop the stream. This way,
everyone at a party, eating at a restaurant, or relaxing at home can
control the music being played without interfering with one-another and without
even standing up.
